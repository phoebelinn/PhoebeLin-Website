        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Phoebe Lin and I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying pre-business in hopes of applying to the School of Business in the future. I started getting interested in business through IB business courses in high school and a marketing internship at Arborland Montessori Childrenâ€™s Academy. Through those business courses, I was able to grasp the basic concept of business and the different parts of the field. After completing those courses, I wanted to gain some experience as well. My internship at Arborland Montessori Children's Academy solidified my interest in business. It was specifically a marketing internship, so my mentor gave me the opportunity to create a promotional video for the schoolâ€™s summer program. It was very exciting getting to work on such a big project by myself. Throughout the process, I was able to work with the teachers and students alike when it came to deciding what I should record, who I was allowed to feature, and the best parts of the program that was essential to include. My mentor helped tremendously by providing me tips and showing me what a professional video should look like. Overall, I was able to obtain basic marketing skills from this internship and get a little experience in the field that I can apply to any future endeavors I take in business.<br><br>

        Besides my experience in the business field, I also had experience in many other industries. For example, I did volunteer work for much of high school. I was in multiple volunteer organizations that helped out different groups of people in the community. One of the organizations I was in was called Heart of Hope, which is an organization that aims to help children with special needs enhance their communication skills. Volunteers were paired with members and helped them with activities such as crafts and sports while creating a meaningful relationship with their members. Being in an organization like this allowed me to not only teach others, but also learn quite a lot myself. I learned how to work with a variety of people with different skill sets and perspectives, which I can utilize in many other endeavors in which I need to work with a team of people. I also partook in many types of leadership roles in high school. One of my favorite roles I took on was the Media Manager for Music Arts to Youth, a school club. I enjoyed working this role because it utilized many of the marketing skills I had learned in my classes and internship. I was in charge of promoting the club through their social media, which ranged from creating fun visual posts to providing information for uninformed students. From this role, I learned how to cater to specific audiences and how keeping up with analytics is essential to making sure the audience is engaged.<br><br>

        While I was not getting paid at any of the previous experiences, I got my first job during summer of 2023 at Miniso as a sales associate. I am still working here under seasonal hours. This job has taught me tremendously about a variety of things and has improved my professional competence. I learned how to communicate with my manager over my hours and work hand-in-hand with other associates on projects. Overall, it has taught me how to work in a professional setting greatly.
